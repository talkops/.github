# 🗣️ TalkOps – A Modular Voice Interaction

**TalkOps** is a community-driven project designed to enable seamless and modular interaction with applications through **voice** and **text**.

## 🚀 Why TalkOps?

The goal of **TalkOps** is to provide an **open, flexible, and scalable solution** that allows anyone to add **voice functionalities** and automate software interactions without relying on proprietary solutions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

 The architecture is built around a **real-time AI Agent**, enhanced by a system of **containerized services** with **[Docker](https://link.talkops.app/docker)**:

- **Agent**: The central interface managing communication between the interface and the modules.
- **Extensions**: Integrate third-party applications (e.g., home automation assistant).
- **Add-ons**: Provide optional features (e.g., voice activation with a keyword).
- **Kernel**: Defines the API and AI configuration.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Voice & text interaction** via a [Progressive Web App](https://link.talkops.app/pwa) (PWA).
- **Full modularity** with an architecture based on **[Docker](https://link.talkops.app/docker)**.
- **Extensibility** through **open-source extensions** available on GitHub.
- **Easy installation** and management via **Docker Compose**.
- **Self-hosted deployment** for **complete control** over data and privacy.

## 🌍 Contribution & Ecosystem

**TalkOps** is an **open** and **collaborative** project. We encourage contributions in the form of:

- 🛠️ Developing new **[extensions](https://link.talkops.app/create-extension)**.
- 💡 Sharing ideas and **innovative use cases**.
